  <h2>👨‍💻 About Me</h2>
  <p>
   Hi, I’m Mert — an Electronics Engineer based in Germany with a Master’s degree in Information Technologies.<br /> 
   After gaining hands-on experience as a software developer, I transitioned into a Product Owner role. <br />
   I like to call my approach “Delivery Engineering” because it encompasses the full engineering lifecycle — from 
   defining clear requirements to ensuring successful product deployments. I’m passionate about bridging technical 
   excellence with strategic delivery to create impactful solutions. <br />
  
   I am impact-oriented Product Owner with 6+ years’experience driving software and hardware solutions in Internet 
   of Things and e-commerce sectors. I possess strong expertise in Agile methodologies, backlog refinement, and MVP 
   delivery, consistently maximizing product value and user satisfaction. I prioritize features aligned with company 
   goals, facilitate cross-functional collaboration, and effectively manage stakeholder expectations. With a solid 
   technical background spanning software and hardware development, I combine strategic thinking with disciplined execution. 
   I am skilled at guiding product roadmaps, defining KPIs, and fostering alignment across teams and leadership.
