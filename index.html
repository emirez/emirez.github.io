  <h1>Mert Irez</h1>
  <p> Welcome to my personal website! <br />
  Hi, I’m Mert — an Electronics Engineer based in Germany with a Master’s degree in Information Technologies.<br /> 
  After gaining hands-on experience as a software developer, I transitioned into a Product Owner role. <br />
  I like to call my approach “Delivery Engineering” because it encompasses the full engineering lifecycle — from 
  defining clear requirements to ensuring successful product deployments. I’m passionate about bridging technical 
  excellence with strategic delivery to create impactful solutions. <br />
  
  I am impact-oriented Product Owner with 6+ years’experience driving software and hardware solutions in Internet 
  of Things and e-commerce sectors. I possess strong expertise in Agile methodologies, backlog refinement, and MVP 
  delivery, consistently maximizing product value and user satisfaction. I prioritize features aligned with company 
  goals, facilitate cross-functional collaboration, and effectively manage stakeholder expectations. With a solid 
  technical background spanning software and hardware development, I combine strategic thinking with disciplined execution. 
  I am skilled at guiding product roadmaps, defining KPIs, and fostering alignment across teams and leadership. </p>
